## Installation Details

The installer script automatically:
- Creates a Python virtual environment with all required dependencies
- Sets up a systemd user service to run at startup
- Creates desktop shortcuts and application entries
- Validates your monitor configuration

### Uninstalling

To uninstall Monitor Mouse Mapper:

```bash
python3 install_service.py --uninstall
```

## Managing the Service

Monitor Mouse Mapper runs as a systemd user service:

- **Check status**: `systemctl --user status monitor-mouse-mapper.service`
- **Start**: `systemctl --user start monitor-mouse-mapper.service`
- **Stop**: `systemctl --user stop monitor-mouse-mapper.service`
- **View logs**: `journalctl --user -u monitor-mouse-mapper.service -n 50`

## Troubleshooting

- **X11 vs Wayland**: Make sure you're using X11 (log out and select "Ubuntu on Xorg" at login)
- **Wrong Monitor Configuration**: Run the configurator tool if your monitor setup has changed
- **Service Not Starting**: Check logs with `journalctl --user -u monitor-mouse-mapper.service`
